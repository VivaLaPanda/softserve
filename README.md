# Softserve

Microscopic Go utility to take standard input and expose it over a chunked HTTP response. 

* Simple use case: Exposing live log output from a program to a webpage without needing refreshes
* Cool usecase: Stream an mp3 over the network

I basically made this to test mp3 streaming for my UtaStream project
